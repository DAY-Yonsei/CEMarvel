Although what remains today is mainly from the Ming dynasty that existed from 14th to 17th century, we can see that the first emperor wanted to defend China from the intrusion of various nomadic powers. There must have been lots of hurdles to overcome to construct the great wall. Lots of people may have been injured or even died during the construction. But we see the purpose of this monumental structure. This was to protect lives and wealth of people.",

After a successful completion of the Suez Canal, the French tried to complete this project but in vain. Technical difficulties, hostile climate, and political issues had led to the failure. It was Americans who took over the construction in early 20th century. They tried to solve those problems identified by the French people. They used the lock-approach to have different water elevations in the canal. They controlled mosquitos to deal with the disease of yellow fever. They even supported a revolution that led to the formation of Republic of Panama.",
